# Effect runtime visualizer

This is a visualizer for Effect runtime. It allows you to visualize the execution of Effect code in the browser.

This project is a learning project for me to understand the Effect runtime. Check out the [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) file for more information:

- Most of the UI is generated by Cursor
- The Effect related code is written by me, guided by Cursor
