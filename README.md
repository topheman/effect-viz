# Effect runtime visualizer

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-online-blue.svg)](https://effect-viz.vercel.app)

This is a visualizer for Effect runtime. It allows you to visualize the execution of Effect code in the browser.

This project is a learning project for me to understand the Effect runtime. The learning journey is documented in the [`workshop/`](./workshop/) folder, with each phase covering different Effect concepts (lazy evaluation, fibers, scheduling, errors, scopes). Check out the [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) file for the teaching approach:

- Most of the UI is generated by Cursor
- The Effect related code is written by me, guided by Cursor as a tutor
- See [`workshop/README.md`](./workshop/README.md) for the complete learning journey and [`workshop/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./workshop/ARCHITECTURE.md) for design decisions

This is the v1 of the project. V2 will be released soon - see roadmap in [`workshop/README.md`](./workshop/README.md#phase-documentation)
